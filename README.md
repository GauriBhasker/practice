we have created a simple java web application for maven project using java servlet .


-- we need to open our eclipse
after that we need to install a local server(tomcat)

-- then we need to run our code 
it will we open in any web browser (localhost:8080)

it show you a simple form when we fill that form then we will press submit it will call automatically java servlet 
and give the output as which we have fill that form .
